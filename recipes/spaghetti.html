        <p>Million dollar spaghetti is the perfect combination of noodles, lean ground beef sauce, cottage cheese, cream cheese, and sour cream. It's unbelievably good! Serve with garlic bread and salad. </p>
        <ul><strong>Ingredients:</strong>
            <li>Spaghetti: An 8-ounce package of spaghetti should make about eight servings. </li>

            <li>Spaghetti sauce: Use a jar of store-bought spaghetti sauce or make your own marinara sauce at home. </li>
            <li>Butter: Use a stick of sliced butter to prepare the pan and to add richness and flavor to the baked spaghetti. </li>
            <li>Cottage cheese, cream cheese, and sour cream: A mixture of cottage cheese, cream cheese, and sour cream is essential for this decadent, creamy spaghetti sauce. </li>
            <li>Cheese: Shredded Cheddar cheese is the perfect finishing touch for this million dollar spaghetti. </li>
        </ul>

            <li>Boil the spaghetti in salted water, then drain and set aside. </li>
